class optional(str):
    """
    Input values in ``needs`` may be designated as optional using this modifier.
    If this modifier is applied to an input value, that value will be input to
    the ``operation`` if it is available.  The function underlying the
    ``operation`` should have a parameter with the same name as the input value
    in ``needs``, and the input value will be passed as a keyword argument if
    it is available.

    Here is an example of an operation that uses an optional argument::

        from networkfox import operation, compose
        from networkfox.modifiers import optional

        # Function that adds either two or three numbers.
        def myadd(a, b, c=0):
            return a + b + c

        # Designate c as an optional argument.
        graph = compose('mygraph')(
            operator(name='myadd', needs=['a', 'b', optional('c')], provides='sum')(myadd)
        )

        # The graph works with and without 'c' provided as input.
        assert graph({'a': 5, 'b': 2, 'c': 4})['sum'] == 11
        assert graph({'a': 5, 'b': 2})['sum'] == 7
